      <div class="text-section__paragraphs">
        <p>
          The load-bearing capacity of our concrete pavers is four times that of
          poured concrete, making them the most durable option for your
          driveway. Moreover, cracking is not an issue because the pavers can
          shift as the ground moves. Consequently, the aesthetic appeal of your
          driveway will endure for decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driveway edging keeps gravel in place while improving a driveway's
          appearance. There are numerous options for driveway edging depending
          on your preferences, budget, and landscape requirements. Instances
          include brick, stone, and steel edging. Choose a durable and
          aesthetically pleasing edging material to achieve your objectives.
          Fortunately, our experienced installers can help you with this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most homeowners edge their driveways with permeable pavers. These
          pavers protect the driveway from erosion and drainage-related damage.

        <p>
          Pavers provide the most stable support, as poured concrete is prone to
          cracking and settlement. By shifting with the movement of the ground,
          pavers are less likely to crack. You can select the option that
          complements your landscape design the most from a variety of sizes,
          shapes, and colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your family can use the newly installed paver patio immediately, as
          pavers do not need to cure.

      </div>
      <div class="text-section__paragraphs">
        <p>
          We install permeable pavers to encourage slow water drainage. To
          facilitate the movement of water through the soil, our installers use
          larger gravel particles and "open" spaces. Thus, the water is exposed
          to fewer potentially hazardous contaminants, reducing contaminated
          runoff and safeguarding watersheds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although permeable pavers are more expensive, their installation can
          be completed in record time. An experienced Lafayette paver contractor
          can complete the installation quickly, allowing you to use the outdoor
          space immediately. These pavers do not require a separate drainage
          system for the vast majority of residential properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Installing permeable pavers for a patio, pool deck, or pathway is an
          environmentally responsible option for hardscaping projects.

          Interlocking pavers are available in a variety of colors and designs
          to complement any landscape design with minimal upkeep. They are
          extremely durable and can withstand the elements for a longer period
          of time than standard pavers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to poured concrete, interlocking pavers are less prone to
          cracking or chipping due to temperature fluctuations and other
          environmental factors. Due to their ability to move in the direction
          of tension, they flourish in colder climates.

          Our knowledgeable Lafayette paver designers will help you select the
