        <h2>Driveway Pavers and Edging Installation</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="text-section__paragraphs">
        <p>
          Numerous residents of Daly City recommend concrete pavers for driveway
          paving. And for good reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our concrete pavers have four times the load-bearing capacity of
          poured concrete, making them the most durable option for your
          driveway. Furthermore, the pavers can shift as the ground moves, so
          cracking is not an issue. Your driveway's appearance will endure for
          decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cracks in poured concrete and asphalt driveways necessitate expensive
          patching and repair while diminishing a driveway's pristine
          appearance. In contrast, damaged pavers are simple to replace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driveway edging keeps gravel in place while enhancing the appearance
          of the driveway. There are numerous options for driveway edging
          depending on your preferences, budget, and landscape requirements. For
          example, brick, stone, and rubber paver edging are available, as well
          as steel edging. To achieve your objectives, choose a durable and
          aesthetically pleasing edging material.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to providing style and structure to your driveway, proper
          edging can safeguard the health of the plants along its perimeter. It
          will demarcate the driveway's perimeter and prevent grass intrusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most homeowners surround their driveways with pavers that allow water
          to return to the soil. These permeable pavers safeguard the driveway
          against erosion and drainage-related damage.

      <div class="text-section__paragraphs">
        <p>
          Since poured concrete is susceptible to cracking and settlement,
          pavers provide the most stable support. They shift when the ground
          moves, thereby decreasing the possibility of cracking. You can select
          the option that complements your landscape design the most from a
          variety of sizes, shapes, and colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use a newly installed paver patio immediately; pavers require
          no curing time!

          out and provide your family with a relaxing space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paver-built pool decks are UV-resistant, stain-resistant, and
          low-maintenance. Additionally, they are slip-resistant and durable, so
          you can rest assured that your family will be safe for years to come.

        <p>
          Pavers made from concrete produce aesthetically pleasing pathways
          around your home. If properly maintained, they can last for decades.
          We stock a variety of sizes, hues, and textures to complement any
          landscape or architectural design.

          Concrete pavers will enhance your design if you desire a straight

          making them appropriate for all ages.

        <h2>Dependable Permeable Pavers Installation</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="text-section__paragraphs">
        <p>
          We install permeable pavers to encourage slow water drainage through
          the base layers. This technique for laying pavers is known as "open
          grading." We use larger gravel pieces and more "open" spaces to
          encourage water movement through the soil. Consequently, the water is
          exposed to fewer potentially harmful contaminants, reducing harmful
          runoff and protecting watersheds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although permeable pavers are typically more costly to install, their
          installation is typically faster. Typically, a skilled Daly City paver
          contractor can complete the installation quickly, allowing you to
          begin enjoying your outdoor space immediately. In addition, they do
          not need a separate drainage system, so their price is comparable to
          that of conventional concrete pavers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Permeable pavers are an excellent environmentally friendly option for
          hardscaping projects like installing a patio, pool deck, or walkway.

          Numerous residential hardscaping applications are ideal candidates for
          interlocking pavers. They are low-maintenance, and we offer them in a
          range of colors and styles to complement any landscape design.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, they are extremely durable and can withstand the elements
          for a longer time than conventional pavers. Moreover, interlocking
          pavers are less likely to crack or chip as a result of temperature
          fluctuations and other environmental factors. They are ideal for
          colder climates due to the fact that they flex slightly in the
          direction of tension.
