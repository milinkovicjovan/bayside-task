      <h2>A Retaining wall can give your house the perfect balance.</h2>
      <p>
        Retaining walls are a common sight around many Bay area homes. A
        retaining wall is first and foremost a functional element in your
        landscape. They are used to terrace slopes to create level areas in your
        yard or used on a steep vertical, or near-vertical slope to keep soil in
        place.
      </p>
      <p>
        While their first duty is to provide stability and prevent erosion which
        can damage your expensive landscaping or even your home, They can also
        be a stunning visual element in your landscape design!
      </p>
      <p>
        Create Landscape Design With Retaining Walls in the San Francisco Bay
        Area
      </p>
      <p>
        Retaining walls are the perfect functional element to help you shape
        your landscape. Properly constructed, a concrete block, stone, or brick
        retaining wall can prevent erosion and confine soil safely allowing you
        to create usable areas in your outdoor environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many considerations that can affect the design and cost of a
        retaining wall system. Soil make-up, whether it is sandy, or heavy clay,
        is a significant element that controls both the price and design of your
        retaining wall system.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Bayside Pavers, we understand and take into consideration all of
        these elements when designing retaining walls for our clients. Some
        retaining walls are shorter and designed to hold back small slopes,
        while others are much larger and must be engineered to keep tons of rock
        and soil in place. No matter what size you need, we can design the
        perfect retaining wall to meet your needs. Our retaining walls in the
        Bay Area don’t crumble or decompose, are relatively maintenance-free,
        and most importantly, engineered for proper safety!
      </p>
      <h2>Increase the Value of your home</h2>
      <p>
        A retaining wall can even increase the value of your home. It provides
        privacy and is made to appear aesthetically pleasing. They can also help
        to separate one area of your yard from another.
      </p>
      <p>
        While their main function is definitely to retain soil, retaining walls
        don’t have to be an unattractive and boring component of your yard. Your
        retaining wall can coordinate with the rest of your landscape design. It
        can also help to direct your focal point to a certain area of the yard.
        Although retaining walls are built to do a job, they can still be a
        pretty part of your yard. Shorter retaining walls sometimes section off
        gardens, creating a special space for them.

      <h2>Do not Neglect Aesthetics</h2>
      <p>
        Just because a retaining wall is first and foremost a functional element
        of your landscape design doesn’t mean it can’t do its job and still look
        amazing! We build our retaining walls to not only provide safe service
        but also to be aesthetically pleasing. A retaining wall can ensure
        privacy, and be used to separate different areas of your outdoor living
        space.
      </p>
      <p>
        While their main job is to retain soil, retaining walls can also be a
        significant visual element in your landscape design. They can be
        constructed to coordinate with the rest of your landscaping. A retaining
        wall can also help direct your visual focal point to a specific area of
        your yard, like the backyard fire pit, or pool deck. A retaining wall
        can be a beautiful element of your landscape design.
      </p>
      <h2>Choose from a wide range of colors, textures, and sizes.</h2>
      <p>
        Because retaining walls are constructed of concrete blocks, it’s
        possible to create walls that twist and turn, creating beautiful winding
        elements throughout your landscape. Today, manufacturers offer a variety
        of blocks that can be used for both retaining and freestanding walls in
        your design. They come in various sizes, materials, colors, and shapes.
        Using pre-designed curved blocks, blocks, flats, and matching capstones,
        it’s possible to transform your yard into a beautiful, relaxing oasis
        that can not only help to protect your home from the dangers of erosion
        but can also be a perfect spot for entertaining family and friends.
