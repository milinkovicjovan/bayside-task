            Retaining walls are a common sight around many Bay area homes. A
            retaining wall is first and foremost a functional element in your
            landscape. They are used to terrace slopes to create level areas in
            your yard or used on a steep vertical, or near-vertical slope to
            keep soil in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            While their first duty is to provide stability and prevent erosion
            which can damage your expensive landscaping or even your home, They
            can also be a stunning visual element in your landscape design!

          </p>
          <p>
            Retaining walls are the perfect functional element to help you shape
            your landscape. Properly constructed, a concrete block, stone, or
            brick retaining wall can prevent erosion and confine soil safely
            allowing you to create usable areas in your outdoor environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many considerations that can affect the design and cost of
            a retaining wall system. Soil make-up, whether it is sandy, or heavy
            clay, is a significant element that controls both the price and
            design of your retaining wall system.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Bayside Pavers, we understand and take into consideration all of
            these elements when designing retaining walls for our clients. Some
            retaining walls are shorter and designed to hold back small slopes,
            while others are much larger and must be engineered to keep tons of
            rock and soil in place. No matter what size you need, we can design
            the perfect retaining wall to meet your needs. Our retaining walls
            in the Bay Area don’t crumble or decompose, are relatively
            maintenance-free, and most importantly, engineered for proper
            safety!

          <p>
            A retaining wall can even increase the value of your home. It
            provides privacy and is made to appear aesthetically pleasing. They
            can also help to separate one area of your yard from another.
          </p>
          <p>
            While their main function is definitely to retain soil, retaining
            walls don’t have to be an unattractive and boring component of your
            yard. Your retaining wall can coordinate with the rest of your
            landscape design. It can also help to direct your focal point to a
            certain area of the yard. Although retaining walls are built to do a
            job, they can still be a pretty part of your yard. Shorter retaining
            walls sometimes section off gardens, creating a special space for
            them.

          Just because a retaining wall is first and foremost a functional
          element of your landscape design doesn’t mean it can’t do its job and
          still look amazing! We build our retaining walls to not only provide
          safe service but also to be aesthetically pleasing. A retaining wall
          can ensure privacy, and be used to separate different areas of your
          outdoor living space.

          While their main job is to retain soil, retaining walls can also be a
          significant visual element in your landscape design. They can be
          constructed to coordinate with the rest of your landscaping. A
          retaining wall can also help direct your visual focal point to a
          specific area of your yard, like the backyard fire pit, or pool deck.
          A retaining wall can be a beautiful element of your landscape design.

          Because retaining walls are constructed of concrete blocks, it’s
          possible to create walls that twist and turn, creating beautiful
          winding elements throughout your landscape. Today, manufacturers offer
          a variety of blocks that can be used for both retaining and
          freestanding walls in your design. They come in various sizes,
          materials, colors, and shapes. Using pre-designed curved blocks,
          blocks, flats, and matching capstones, it’s possible to transform your
          yard into a beautiful, relaxing oasis that can not only help to
          protect your home from the dangers of erosion but can also be a
          perfect spot for entertaining family and friends.
